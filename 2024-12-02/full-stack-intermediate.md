### General Requirements:

#### Front-End:

- **User Interface (UI):**
    - **Authentication Pages:**
        - User registration (sign-up) with email verification.
        - User login and password reset functionality.
    - **Dashboard:**
        - Overview of assigned tasks, team activities, and notifications.
    - **Task Management:**
        - Create, edit, and delete tasks.
        - Assign tasks to oneself or team members.
        - Set task priorities and due dates.
        - Mark tasks as complete or in-progress.
    - **Team Collaboration:**
        - Create and manage teams.
        - Invite users to join teams via email.
        - Real-time chat or comment section for each task.
    - **Notifications:**
        - In-app notifications for task assignments and updates.
        - Optionally, email notifications for critical updates.
    - **Responsive Design:**
        - Accessible on various devices (desktops, tablets, smartphones).

#### Back-End:

- **APIs and Endpoints:**
    - **Authentication API:**
        - Secure user authentication (sign-up, login, logout).
        - Token-based authentication (e.g., JWT).
    - **User Management API:**
        - CRUD operations for user profiles.
        - Password management and account settings.
    - **Task Management API:**
        - CRUD operations for tasks.
        - Assigning and reassigning tasks.
        - Updating task status and progress.
    - **Team Management API:**
        - Create and manage teams.
        - Add or remove team members.
    - **Notification API:**
        - Generate and retrieve notifications.
        - Manage notification preferences.
- **Database:**
    - **Entities:**
        - Users
        - Teams
        - Tasks
        - Comments/Chat messages
        - Notifications
    - **Relationships:**
        - Users can belong to multiple teams.
        - Teams have multiple users.
        - Tasks are assigned to users and associated with teams.
- **Security:**
    - Input validation and sanitization to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
    - Secure password storage (e.g., hashing with salt).
    - Access control to ensure users can only access authorized data.
- **Scalability:**
    - Structuring the application to handle an increasing number of users and tasks.
    - Implementing pagination for lists of tasks and users.

#### Additional Features (Optional for Advanced Functionality):

- **Real-Time Updates:**
    - Implement WebSockets or a similar technology to provide real-time updates on task statuses and new comments.
- **Analytics Dashboard:**
    - Visual representations of task progress, completion rates, and team productivity.
- **Integration:**
    - Calendar integration to sync task due dates.
    - Third-party integrations (e.g., Slack, email clients) for notifications.
- **Testing:**
    - Unit and integration tests for both front-end and back-end components.

### Constraints and Guidelines:

- **Programming Language Agnostic Back-End:**
    - You may choose any server-side language and framework (e.g., Node.js, Python, Ruby, Java, Go) to implement the back-end, as long as it meets the requirements.
- **Development Practices:**
    - Follow MVC or a similar architectural pattern to organize code.
    - Use version control (e.g., Git) throughout the development process.
    - Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.
- **Deployment:**
    - Prepare the application for deployment on a server or cloud platform.
    - Include instructions for setting up the development and production environments.
- **Accessibility and Compliance:**
    - Design the UI to be accessible (e.g., following WCAG guidelines).
    - Ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations if deploying publicly (e.g., GDPR).

### Project Goals:

- **Intermediate Complexity:**
    - The project is intended to challenge your skills in full-stack development without being overwhelming.
- **Learning Outcomes:**
    - Implementing user authentication and authorization.
    - Managing complex data relationships in a database.
    - Enhancing front-end skills with dynamic UI updates and responsive design.
    - Understanding back-end API development and integration with the front-end.
- **Extensibility:**
    - The application should be designed in a way that allows for future enhancements and additional features.
